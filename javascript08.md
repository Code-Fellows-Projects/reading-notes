# Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions

You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be.
Boolean: true or false

(==) is equal too
    - 'Hello ' == // 'Goodbye ' false
(!=) not equal to // 'Hello '! = 'Goodbye ' true
(===) strict equal to // '3' === 3 false / '3' ==='3' True
(!==) strict not equal to // '3' ! == 3 true / '3'!=='3' false
(>) greater than
(<) less than
(>=) greater than or equal to 
(<=) less than or equal to

## Logical Operators - True or False

(&&) - Logical and
(||) - Logical or
(!) - Logical not

## Loops

### For
    - Runs a code a specific number of times (most common)
### While
    - When you don't know how many times to run continue to loop as long as condition is true
### Do while
    - Always run the statement inside { } at least once even if condition in false

## Loop Counters
    - Initialization - create variable sets to 0 called i and acts as counter
            - var i = 0;
    - Condition -
