# Day 1 Summary
Today we learned to set up our computers for coding. I have gotten to a place where I am officaially stuck! I was able to download and use Ubuntu but after googling and googling I still cant seem to get my software fully updated. I was past the install node step. When I installed NVM it worked but then when I exit terminal and log back in NVM install 12 doesnâ€™t work. Today I feel a bit defeated but I hope to get this issue resolved. Although I did not get through the assignment, I had alot of fun getting through what I did which gives me hope for the rest of school!
## Continuing on
Since I couldn't get everything installed...I really enjoyed the reading "Choosing a text editor" by The Older Coder. I love that a text editor isnt a 1 stop shop. Im curious to try others and see which i prefer in the future. Lots of infor on text editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Editor) seem to be more multi-functional. I have a feeling I will like IDEs for my future.
