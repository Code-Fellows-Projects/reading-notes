# Lets learn some JavaScript Baby!

How do I write a script for a web page?

What is JaveScript??
- The muscle for your page
- Makes it functional
- Programming language

Variable = temorary storage of something

var name = 'Stacy'
console.log(name + 'is your awesome');
| Stacy is awesome |

DO NOT USE document.write

HTML = content layer
CSS = presentation layer
Javascript = behavior layer

## Reminders:

Keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file
Files like HTML and CSS but they have a .js extension
Uses the <script> tag to link it to html.

Terms to understand:
- code block: refer to if, else if, else
- multi-line: /*    */
- single-line: // descriptions of code for you

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true and false values known as Booleans

var = variable
camelCase :)
