## Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)

+ In CSS you can specify the width ang height of an image. 
    + `<img src="">`
        `img. large, medium or small {`
            `width: 500px;`
            `height: 500px;}`
        
        + This is helpful when using same sized images on multiple pages.
+ You ca align images vertically and horizontally
+ Background images can be appear once or be customized
    + repeat = image will repeat on page both vertically and horizontally
    + repeat-x = repeated horizontally only
    + repeat-y = repeated vertically only
    + no-repeat = image only shows once
    + fixed = image does move when page in scrolled
    + scroll = image scrolls as user scrolls page
+ To reduced the number of images your browser has to load you can create image sprites (good for logos or buttons to images)
