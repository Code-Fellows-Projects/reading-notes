# But how do computers work??
## Facinating stuff!

What makes a computer a computer?
Great question: 

- tools to help us solve problems
- can a machine do that?

4 tasks: 
- Take input
    - what the world or you do that makes the computer do stuff
- store info
- Process it 
- output 

- Takes info from memory, manipulates or changes it using algorithm. Then sends it back to the memory

- Output from one computer becomes inpuit to another

### Fun fact
Earliest computers made out of wood and metal!?!


- mechanical levers and gears
- basic calculators

### Binary:
    - on off = bits
    - 1s and 0s binary number system.....
    - Any number can be represented with 1s and 0s
    - wires that are on or off
        - 8 wires store 0 - 255
        - 32 wires store 0 - over 4 billion
    - Text - Image - Sound also represented with numbers!
    - Text and sound in binary....pixels and cuircits

- Input devices into binary info 
- ex. keyboard, microphone
- memory - gitabits to store
- 
### CPU 
    - central processing unit 
        - master chip
        - softwares tells what to do
        - Converts info to physical output
