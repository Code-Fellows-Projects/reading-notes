# But how do computers work??
## Fascinating stuff!

What makes a computer a computer?
Great question 

- Tools to help us solve problems....
- can a machine do that?

Four tasks: 
1. Take input
2. store info
3. Process it 
4. output 

- Takes info from memory, manipulates or changes it
- Using algorithm. Then sends it back to the memory
- Output from one computer becomes inpuit to another

### Fun fact
Earliest computers made out of wood and metal!?!

Computers are...
- mechanical levers and gears
- basic calculators

### Binary:
    - on/off = bits
    - 1s and 0s binary number system.....
    - Any number can be represented with 1s and 0s
    - wires that are on or off
        - 8 wires store 0 - 255
        - 32 wires store 0 - over 4 billion

    - Text - Image - Sound also represented with numbers!
    - Text and sound in binary....pixels and circuits

- Input devices into binary info 
- ex. keyboard, microphone
- memory - gigabits to store

### CPU 
    - central processing unit 
        - master chip
        - software tells what to do
        - Converts info to physical output
