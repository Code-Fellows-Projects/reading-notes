+ A database is nothing but a collection of organized data. It doesnâ€™t have to be in a digital format to
be called a database. A telephone directory is a good example, which stores data about people and
organizations with a contact number. Software which is used to manage a digital database is called
a Database Management System (DBMS)

+ A table in a relational database is nothing but a matrix of data where the columns describe the type
of data and the row contains the actual data to be stored.
