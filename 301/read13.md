### Sending Form Data

+ Client/server architecture:
  + The web uses a client/server architecture
  + a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. 
  + The server answers the request using the same protocol.
  + An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.

+ The `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent
+ The action attribute defines where the data gets sent
+ The method attribute defines how data is sent

+ **The GET method** is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource

+ **The POST method** is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request
