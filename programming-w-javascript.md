# How JavaScript makes web pages more interactive

1. Acccess content - the content of page
2. Modify Content - the content of page
3. program rules - rules of instructions the browser can follow
4. React - to events triggered by the user browser

- Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step
- A browser may use different parts of a script depending on how the user interacts with the web page
- Scripts can run different sections of the code in responding to situation

Learn new skill - break it down into steps
Script is a searies of short instructions
1. Define the goal - what you want it to achieve
2. Design the script
3. Code each step

Vocabulary - the words that a computer understands
Syntax - How you put those words together to create instruction for the computer

- Programmatic apporach to problem solving

- Use flowcharts to work out how tasks fit together pg. 23

pg 74 - 79 

- Expressions - evaluates into (result in) a single value. 2 types:
    1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
    2. Exoressions that use 2 or more values to return a single value
- Operations - Expressions rely on operators. Allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values

### Assignment operators

- Assign a value to variable

### Comparison Operators

- compare two values and return true or false

### Arithmetic Operators 

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Division (/)
- Mutiplication (*)
- Increment (++)
- Decrement (--)
- Modulus (%)

### String Operator

### Whats a function?

- group a series of statements together to perform a specific task

calling
Parameters:
Return value

basic function pg 89
- Declaring a function
function sayHello() {
    document.write('Hello!); }
    - Declaring function that needs info
    function getArea(width, height) {
        return width * height; }

- Calling a function
    sayHello();

    - Calling function that needs info
    Argument as values:
        getArea(3, 5);
    Arguments as variables
        wallWidth = 3;
        wallHeight = 5;
        getArea(wallWidth, wallHeight);

    ### Parameter vs Arguments
    variables = parameter
    values = arguments

- Getting single value out of  a function pg 94
