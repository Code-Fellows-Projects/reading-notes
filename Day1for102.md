# Day 1 Summery
- Today we learned to set up our computers for coding. I have gotten to a place where I am officaially stuck. After googling and googling I still cant seem to get fully my software updated.
I can't seem to get past the install node step. When I installed NVM it worked but then when I exit terminal and log back in nvm install 12 doesnâ€™t work. Today I feel a bit defeated but I hopw that to get this issue resolved.
