# Readings: Event Driven Architecture

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?** They essentially have the same features but FIFO queues provide the added benefit of supporting ordering and exactly once processing. Helps prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent/ received by message products.
2. **How can the server be assured a message was properly received?** Store messages in a queue
3. **What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?** 
4. **How do you test an event driven system?** Emitting different events

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

+ FIFO Queue - messages are ordered based on message group IDs
+ Pub/Sub - This is an asynchronous messaging service that processes events.
