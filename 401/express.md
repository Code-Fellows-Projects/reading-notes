1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

  + A PUT request always contains a full resource. So a PUT request replaces or update an entire set of data.
  + PATCH request is use to make changes to part of the data

2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
  1. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
  2. [Mockable.io](https://www.mockable.io/)
  3. [Spotlight.io](https://stoplight.io/)

3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js: 

  + Swagger creates a .yml file or .json file that contains the most current or accurate information on your API where as APIDoc.js is a template engine that makes an API documentation.

4. Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST:

+ SOAP and REST share similarities over the HTTP protocol, SOAP is a more rigid set of messaging patterns than REST.
+ SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a standards-based web services access protocol.
+ REST (Representational State Transfer) is another standard, made in response to SOAP’s shortcomings. It seeks to fix the problems with SOAP and provide a simpler method of accessing web services.
