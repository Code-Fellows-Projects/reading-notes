## Solving Problems

+ A simple set of steps to follow which you can use for an algorithm type programming problem:
  1. Read the problem completely twice.
  2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
  3. Optimize the manual steps.
  4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
  5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
  6. Optimize the real code.

+ Read the problem 3-4 times so you really understand what it is asking and be able to explain to someone else.
```
Let’s look at some psudeo-code for reversing a string.
// NewWord = “”
// Loop backwards through word to reverse
//   NewWord += CurrentLetter
// Return NewWord
```
+ Write the problem out like this so you know the steps you will use to solve it.

+ Make sure your variable names are long and meaningful

## Act like you make $1000/hr

- `“Most people have no clue what they are doing with their time but still complain that they don’t have enough.” -Grant Cardone, NYT best-selling author`
- `“Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness`
- `“Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss`
- `It takes discipline to not become “busy.”`

+ Who is in charge of your time???
+ If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.
  + But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.

+ **Value your time**

## How to think like a programmer

+ **The meta-skill**

+ “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs

1. Understand: know exactly what is being asked
  + write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it

2. Plan: plan your solution
  + Comment the problem out before starting

3. Divide: break problem down into sub-problems then connect the dots

4. Stuck: Debug!
  + `“The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer`

5. Practice! 
  + (Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games)

## The 5 Whys

1. Assemble a team: gather people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem.
2. Define the problem: discuss with the team about a clear brief description of what the problem is
3. Ask the first "why?": why is the problem occurring?
4. Ask "why?" Four more times: Frame the next question in response to the answer from the previous one.
5. Know when to stop: you will know when asking the why produces no more useful responses.

```
Note:
The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures," rather than "solutions." A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom. As such, counter-measures are more robust, and will more likely prevent the problem from recurring.
```
```
Key Points
The 5 Whys strategy is a simple, effective tool for uncovering the root of a problem. You can use it in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and quality-improvement initiatives.

Start with a problem and ask why it is occurring. Make sure that your answer is grounded in fact, and then ask the question again. Continue the process until you reach the root cause of the problem, and you can identify a counter-measure that will prevent it from recurring.

Bear in mind that this questioning process is best suited to simple or moderately difficult problems. Complex problems may benefit from a more detailed approach, although using 5 Whys will still give you useful insights.
