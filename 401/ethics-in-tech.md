+ [The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/)

+ I choose this article for the very reason that I thought about this concept before starting school. I think many people have probably faced having to create a website or product for something they don't believe in or down right is harmful. For myself, I believe it is important to trust and believe in the company that you work for. This article being written only a few years ago tells me this is still a much prevalent topic. The only thing I can do for myself is continue to thoroughly research each company I soon apply to and make sure our values align. To me this company didn't seem to do any kind of error checking or concern for a teen age girl. A simple survey should not me the only ticket to obtain such a drug. I truly hope that others read this article too and notice the importance of what kind of power software developers have and make that educated decision to say no if they do not agree no matter the amount of income they may gain.

+ [Self Driving Car Ethics](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/21/self-driving-cars-ethics/804805001/)

+ Ive always been curious about this topic and on a high level I think I would approve of this idea but in reality it is hard to know how I really will feel until it happens. The hypothetical points they covered in the article seemed to address most concerns that I have considered. My lasting though I have is how safe are self driving cars mixed with civilian drivers. Is it better to go all in or be okay with a mixture. Which is safer. Will all self driving cars have a off mode to be able to drive yourself or is the whole point not to have that option? I also believe with the speed of development that this could be executed in a few years. My only thought against that time frame is how much time do you leave for testing? I also was curious about how education as brought into this article. Covering how people would be taught or demonstrated how AVs work and how they don't.
