# Readings: Data Modeling

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
  1. Helps with debugging to less time overall
  2. Gets you to understand code better
  3. Development takes less time

2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- beforeEach() - runs a function before each test
- afterEach() - runs after every test

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- Upfront developer cost because it takes more time to test up but better for a big project

4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
- Classes can extend parent classes and normal constructors cannot

5. Why REST?
 - Stands for (Representative State Transfer protocol) allows transfer of information
