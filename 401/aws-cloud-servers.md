# Readings: AWS: Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?** FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. [aws amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/amazon-sqs-introduces-fifo-queues-with-exactly-once-processing-and-lower-prices-for-standard-queues/#:~:text=FIFO%20queues%20have%20essentially%20the,being%20received%20by%20message%20consumers.)
2. **How can the server be assured a message was properly received?** Servers can request a receipt confirmation
3. **What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?** A messaging service
4. **How do you test an event driven system?** unit tests, sevice tests, end-to-end tests [medium](https://medium.com/dan-on-coding/testing-event-driven-systems-63c6b0c57517)

+ AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS. You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring.
